# Features

The home screen is a list view of all contacts.  By clicking on the title, "My Peeps, Yo!" you can always find your way back home.  Clicking the "Add Contact" link will take you to a form for adding new contacts.  Once a new contact is created, the page automatically takes you back to the home screen.  By clicking on any individual's name, you are taken to an individual contact page.  Each page contains the following information:
  * Contact image
  * Contact name
  * Email
  * Phone number
  * Location

From the individual contact page, there are 2 ways to get back to the home screen--either click on the arrow in the top left corner or click on the page title.
